# Integration 6A — Entity Analysis Pipeline

Module 6 Week A integration task for AI.SPIRE Applied AI & ML Systems.

Build a corpus-level entity analysis pipeline that processes climate articles, extracts entities, computes statistics, and produces visualizations.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Tasks

Complete the six functions in `entity_analysis.py`:
1. `load_corpus(filepath)` — Load the climate articles dataset
2. `preprocess_corpus(df)` — Add a language-aware `processed_text` column (NFC normalization; Arabic rows pass through without crashing; raw `text` preserved for NER)
3. `run_ner_pipeline(df, nlp)` — Filter to English and extract entities using the injected spaCy pipeline
4. `aggregate_entity_stats(entity_df, articles_df)` — Compute top entities, label counts, co-occurrence pairs, and per-category breakdown
5. `visualize_entity_distribution(stats, output_path)` — Create a bar chart of top entities
6. `generate_report(stats, co_occurrence)` — Produce a structured entity analysis report string

## Submission

1. Create a branch: `integration-6a-entity-analysis`
2. Complete `entity_analysis.py`
3. Open a PR to `main`
4. Paste your PR URL into TalentLMS → Module 6 Week A → Integration 6A
